This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using wildcard routes ('/*') in React Router v6.  The problem arises when a wildcard route is placed after more specific routes.  The wildcard route will always match, overriding any preceding routes, even if those routes match the path exactly.  The solution involves reordering routes or using a more precise matching strategy.
